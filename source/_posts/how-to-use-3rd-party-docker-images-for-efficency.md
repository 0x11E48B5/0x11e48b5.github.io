# What is 3rd party docker images?

Third-party Docker container images are `pre-built`, `ready-to-use` Docker images created by organizations, communities, or individuals outside of Docker Inc. These images are hosted on public container registries like Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, or Quay.io, and they provide a convenient way to deploy and use software without having to build it from scratch. Also these images provide ready-to-use software solutions, such as **databases**, **testing environments**, and **CLI utilities**, reducing setup time and ensuring consistency across different environments.

## Benefits of using third party docker images

‚úÖ Faster Deployment ‚Üí Preconfigured images save setup time.
‚úÖ Consistency ‚Üí Ensures software runs the same way across different environments.
‚úÖ Isolation ‚Üí Keeps applications and dependencies separate from the host system.
‚úÖ Community Support ‚Üí Many images are well-maintained by active communities or vendors.

There are different types of third party docker images out there for your needs. We can split up these images into 4 main section;

- General debugging & CLI tools
- Network debugging
- Security & Penetration Testing
- Database Testing

Many pre-built images are ready for us to address these sections. In below, i'll give you valuable examples;

## General Debugging & CLI Tools (Also some base images for containers)

| Image | Description | Usage |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **`debian`** | Minimal Debian image for debugging | `docker run --rm -it debian bash` |
| **`ubuntu`** | Ubuntu container with CLI tools | `docker run --rm -it ubuntu bash` |
| **`alpine`** | Lightweight Alpine Linux for quick tests | `docker run --rm -it alpine sh` |
| **`bash`** | Bash shell container for scripting & testing | `docker run --rm -it bash` |
| **`busybox`** | Smallest Linux utilities toolkit | `docker run --rm -it busybox sh` |

### Usage Examples

#### Debian / Ubuntu - Full Linux Shell
```sh
docker run --rm -it debian bash
docker run --rm -it ubuntu bash
```
#### Alpine - Lightweight Linux Shell
```sh
docker run --rm -it alpine sh
```
#### Standalone Bash Shell
```sh
docker run --rm -it bash
```
Run Bash scripts inside an isolated environment.


## Security & Penetration Testing

| Image | Description | Usage |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **`kalilinux/kali-rolling`** | Full Kali Linux security tools | `docker run -it kalilinux/kali-rolling /bin/bash` |
| **`owasp/zap2docker-stable`** | OWASP ZAP for web security testing | `docker run -it owasp/zap2docker-stable` |
| **`metasploitframework/metasploit-framework`** | Metasploit penetration testing framework | `docker run -it metasploitframework/metasploit-framework` |

### Usage Examples
#### Kali Linux Security Tools
```sh
docker run -it --rm kalilinux/kali-rolling /bin/bash
```

#### Metasploit - Exploit Framework
```sh
docker run -it --rm metasploitframework/metasploit-framework
```

## üåê Network Debugging & Testing

| Image | Description | Usage |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **`nicolaka/netshoot`** | Network troubleshooting toolkit (tcpdump, dig, curl, etc.) | `docker run --rm -it nicolaka/netshoot` |
| **`busybox`** | Lightweight container with basic networking tools | `docker run --rm -it busybox sh` |
| **`tutum/dnsutils`** | DNS utilities (dig, nslookup) | `docker run --rm -it tutum/dnsutils` |
| **`praqma/network-multitool`** | Multi-networking tools (ping, curl, ip, etc.) | `docker run --rm -it praqma/network-multitool` |

### Usage Examples
#### Netshoot - Advanced Network Debugging
```sh
docker run --rm -it --net=host nicolaka/netshoot
```

In here we are using `--net=host` because we want to make debugging in host machine and our local network not inside of the docker network.

#### BusyBox - Lightweight Linux Toolkit
```sh
docker run --rm -it busybox sh
```
#### Network-tools
```sh
docker run --rm -it jonlabelle/network-tools sh
```
#### DNS Utilities
```sh
docker run --rm -it tutum/dnsutils dig example.com
```

## Databases & Storage

| Image | Description | Usage |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **`mysql`** | MySQL database server | `docker run --rm -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root mysql` |
| **`postgres`** | PostgreSQL database server | `docker run --rm -d -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root postgres` |
| **`mongo`** | MongoDB NoSQL database | `docker run --rm -d -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=pass mongo` |
| **`redis`** | In-memory key-value store | `docker run --rm -d redis` |
| **`mariadb`** | MariaDB (MySQL alternative) | `docker run --rm -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root mariadb` |
| **`sqlite`** | Lightweight embedded database | `docker run --rm -it alpine sh -c "apk add sqlite && sqlite3"` |

### Usage Examples
#### Running MySQL
```sh
docker run --rm -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -p 3306:3306 mysql
```
after creation connect using;
```sh
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p
```

#### Running PostgreSQL
```sh
docker run --rm -d -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root -p 5432:5432 postgres
```
after creation connect using;
```sh
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres
```

#### Running Redis
```sh
docker run --rm -d -p 6379:6379 redis
```
after creation connect using;
```sh
redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1
```
- These database containers provide an easy way to test, develop, and debug database-driven applications without setting up full installations!

## Why Third-Party Container Images Matter & How They‚Äôre Used in the Real World  

Third-party container images play a crucial role in modern development, security, and operations by providing **ready-to-use, pre-configured environments** for a variety of use cases. Instead of spending time installing dependencies, configuring settings, and resolving compatibility issues, engineers can pull a containerized tool and start working immediately. This flexibility improves **efficiency, consistency, and scalability** across different workflows.  

In real-world scenarios, these containers are invaluable. For example, security professionals use **Kali Linux** or **Metasploit** containers to conduct penetration testing without modifying their local machines. Developers rely on **PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Redis** containers to spin up databases instantly for testing without permanent installations. DevOps teams frequently use lightweight images like **Alpine** or **Ubuntu** for debugging, while networking engineers leverage tools like **Netshoot** to troubleshoot complex network issues inside Kubernetes or cloud environments.  

By integrating third-party containers into daily workflows, teams can **speed up development, enhance security, and streamline troubleshooting**, all while keeping environments isolated and reproducible. Whether you‚Äôre testing APIs, analyzing logs, debugging networks, or running security assessments, **third-party Docker images empower you to work faster and smarter** without unnecessary overhead.
